# Arrays

## Sort the array of objects

- Load the objects from `movies.json` file
- Print movie titles sorted by IMDB rating
- Use reduce to calculate the total length to watch all the movies

## Work with arrays using LoDash

- Use [lodash][lodash] functions to complete the previous task
- Calculate the total length of movies which were released after 1990
- Print director names alphabetically (no duplicates)
- Print top-billed actors names (no duplicates); use regex to parse Actors field
